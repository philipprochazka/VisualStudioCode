                                    0) Buffer all internet filesystems (like "2" but additionally also ftp, webdav, etc.) 
                                    1) Buffer all filesystems (including local) (default since Kodi 19)
                                    2) Only buffer true internet filesystems (streams) (http, https, etc.)
                                    3) No buffer
                                    4) Buffer all network filesystems (incl. smb, nfs, etc.) -->
  <readfactor>4.0</readfactor> <!-- This factor determines the max readrate in terms of readfactor * avg bitrate of a video file. 
                                    This can help on bad connections to keep the cache filled. It will also greatly speed up buffering. Default value 4.0. -->
